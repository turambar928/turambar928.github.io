<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a junior undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Tongji University. My research interests focus on artificial intelligence, particularly in natural language processing and large language models. I have gained valuable research experience through internships at leading institutions including the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Xi'an Jiaotong University, and have participated in academic programs at University of Oxford.

*Remote · Sep 2024 – Present*
* Participated in government knowledge graph construction project, focusing on efficient construction methods for low-quality corpora. Improved knowledge graph construction quality and completeness, reducing average retrieval time by ~15.3% and increasing information hit rate by ~12.8%; paper published in Journal of Intelligent Systems (CCF-C).
* Developed Vue.js visualization interface for graph presentation.
* Led paper enhancement project leveraging LLM capabilities for automated knowledge graph construction, planned completion Sep 2025 for CCF conference submission.

### Innovation Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University
*Shanghai · Oct 2024 – Jun 2025*
* Led aviation meal prediction system development, utilizing image recognition and data analysis to capture and analyze food residue on meal trays in real-time, predicting future flight meal requirements; responsible for backend development, testing, and recognition model training.
* Led intelligent automotive wire harness matching research, a collaboration with NIO and Shanghai Innovation Project, leveraging LLM technology to improve wire harness allocation efficiency and quality; responsible for project research, planning, software design, modeling, and implementation.

### Machine Intelligence Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University
*Shanghai · Dec 2023 – May 2024*
* Participated in dynamic HBF architecture optimization research under real-time sparse distribution, studying end-to-end HBF network design solutions considering hardware constraints and user channel statistical distribution to improve capacity gains; responsible for code maintenance and algorithm analysis enhancement.
